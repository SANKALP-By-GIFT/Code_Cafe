# 🧪 SDP Open Book Examination

## Project Option: SaaS Subscription Management UI

**Duration: 5 Hours (8:30 AM – 1:30 PM Development)**
**Evaluation: 2:00 – 4:00 PM (Demo + GitHub Review)**
**Difficulty Level: Medium → Moderate Advanced (MCA Level)**

---

# 📌 Problem Statement

You are required to design and implement a **SaaS Subscription Management Frontend Application** using **React (Vite)** that simulates subscription plan selection, authentication flow, billing submission, and secure token handling.

The application must follow modern frontend architectural patterns covered in the SDP syllabus.

This is a **frontend-only project**. Backend will be mocked using `json-server` or `MSW`.

# 🎯 Functional Requirements

## 1️⃣ Authentication Module (Protected Routing Required)

### You must implement:

* Login page
* Fake authentication (mock API)
* Token generation (mock JWT string)
* Store token securely (simulation)
* Redirect authenticated users to dashboard
* Prevent unauthenticated access to protected routes

### Technical Requirements:

* Use **React Router v6**
* Create a `ProtectedRoute` wrapper
* Use **Context API** for auth state
* Simulate token expiry (optional bonus)

---

## 2️⃣ Plan Selection Page

### UI Requirements:

Display at least **3 SaaS subscription plans**:

* Basic
* Pro
* Enterprise

Each plan must show:

* Price
* Features list
* CTA button ("Select Plan")

### Technical Requirements:

* Fetch plans using **React Query**
* Mock API endpoint `/plans`
* Loading & error states required
* Selected plan should be stored in global state (Context)

---

## 3️⃣ Billing Form (React Hook Form + Yup)

After selecting a plan, user must fill billing details:

### Required Fields:

* Full Name
* Email
* Card Number
* Expiry Date
* CVV
* Billing Address

### Validation:

* Use **React Hook Form**
* Use **Yup schema validation**
* Show proper error messages
* Disable submit until valid

On submit:

* Simulate payment success response
* Redirect to confirmation page

---

## 4️⃣ Subscription Dashboard (Protected)

After successful billing:

* Show selected plan details
* Show subscription status (Active)
* Option to "Upgrade Plan"
* Option to "Logout"

---

# 🧠 Architectural Requirements (Mandatory)

## 1️⃣ Context API Usage

Must create:

* `AuthContext`
* `SubscriptionContext`

---

## 2️⃣ Custom Hooks

Create at least:

* `useAuth()`
* `useSubscription()`

Bonus:

* `useTokenExpiry()`

---

## 3️⃣ React Query Usage

Must:

* Use `useQuery()` for plans
* Use `useMutation()` for billing submission
* Configure QueryClient properly

---

## 4️⃣ Routing Structure

Example Structure:

```
/
|-- /login
|-- /plans
|-- /billing
|-- /dashboard
```

Use nested routes if needed.
